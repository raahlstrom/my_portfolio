AI tools like chatGPT and bing chat are going to affect how prospective students conduct their college search. So, it's time to start rethinking content and user journeys in order to future proof your web and digital experiences. In this session, we will share the findings of user testing thatÂ evaluates the common goals of visitors to your website, and compare how they would accomplish each using the website, google search, and an AI assistant. We will discuss the insights from the research, describe the opportunities and dangers of using AI technology, and provide recommendations and takeaways for how industry leaders can adjust to maximize the experience of your prospective students.
