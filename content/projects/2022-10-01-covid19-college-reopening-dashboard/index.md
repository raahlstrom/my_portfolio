In 2020 Higher Education was dealing with the unprecedented disruptions resulting from COVID-19. Over the course of a summer institutions were forced to make decisions about how to return in the fall. For policy makers, higher ed professionals, and journalists it was important to understand how plans changed over time. Using data from [Davidson College & Inside Higher Education](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Here-s-a-List-of-Colleges-/248626?cid=wcontentgrid_hp_1b) I provided longitudinal analysis of plans over time, and filters that allow to show how different types of institutions reacted differently to the pandemic.

This analysis was sited in the [Wall Street Journal]("https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-college-fall-semester-online-lockdown-reopen-harvard-michigan-berkeley-11595949067?mod=e2li"). See the [code]("https://github.com/simpscar/public_analysis").
